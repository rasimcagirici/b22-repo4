I just created empty remote depository from
GitHub.com account by clicking on plus icon on 
top right corner and new repository
and give a name and click create

And cloned this repository by clicking on set
up in Desktop and (optionally select the location)
click on clone

It cloned our remote repo to local so we can 
start working locally
